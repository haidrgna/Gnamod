<ServerGroup Name="Gnamod" Logo="" Description="Gnamod is a collection of mods that aims to create a unique and mostly challenging experience to players that have beaten the base game but find that it does not offer them the same challenge it did when they first started playing. Gnamod will bring back that feeling again to veteran players and will offer a diverse range of challenge modes. 
Gnamod is based around one central mod that is called Gnamod Base, the other challenge modes are all extensions or modifications of this mod, using most of the rules set there. This means that many aspects that make Gnamod unique are in this version. It is also the closest to the vanilla game and offers similar but far more challenging gameplay. Survival in Gnamod is not guaranteed, adapt or die trying.">
<Server Name="Gnamod 1.0 - Base" Logo="">
<Description>
===============Current Version 1.03===============
Gnamod Base is a standalone core experience extension mod. This means that the mod focuses to retain the core 7 Days to Die experience but with more focus on Survival and an overall difficulty increase that doesnâ€™t just increase the zombie strength. This mod will have you on edge trying to survive and will make looting rewarding again without giving you everything you need within a few days. Becoming self-sufficient will be harder and more rewarding. This all set in a completely custom tailored random gen world with specifically designed biomes to create an as realistic as possible apocalyptic world. On top of that the zombies have been improved and enhanced, you will see them behave differently and you will see more of them. They will be harder to fight and there will be times where you will need to run. Survival in Gnamod is not guaranteed!

<Description>
===============Current Version 1.03===============
You are one of the few humans left alive in the remains of a once great metropolis, which is now a Necropolis. It is now the home of the living dead and littered with the remains of warfare. This is your home, you have no choice but to endure and survive. During the day the zombies mostly hide in the bigger buildings that are still standing or bathing in the radiation that surrounds the city, but at night they roam the land in search of food: You!
