  - This controls the top level heading in the Mod Launcher for the mod. All the <Server> tags will be under it.
  
  The same ServerGroup Name="" can be set in different files, and the Mod Launcher will group them under the same heading
  So we could do:   Regular.xml and Advanced.xml, and if they have the same ServerGroup Name, they'll be grouped together.

  - This sets the unique name of each mod.

<ServerGroup Name="Gnamod" Logo="" Description="So you like the game to be a bit more challenging but still retain the feel of the original game? You do not like to have to pick up a class but you do like to survive against all odds?
Then Gnamod may just be the thing for you! This mod comes in different forms but at its core it features completely redone random worlds based on orignal game assets. The loot system has been completely overhauled (and then a few more times) which makes the loot experience unique and rewarding.
Finally this mod increases the challenge of play in various way such as resource requirements and modified zombies tailored to fit with the experience.
NOTE: Parts of this mod are still in flux and under construction. RWG work is mostly done for the base and nomad version so those should be stable enough to play. I am still working on spawning and zombies so those could change while you play. If you want to avoid bugs do not let the launcher update when playing an existing world. Enjoy">

<Description>
Gnamod Horde Mode Testversion. ***THIS IS A TESTVERSION OF THE LATEST GNAMOD BASE. IT IS FULLY PLAYABLE BUT RIGHT NOW IT IS NOT BALANCED. IF YOU WANT TO KEEP PLAYING A WORLD, TURN AUTO UPDATING OFF!***
How to use this version: You can test this version solo and are allowed to record or stream this, but I am contiually working on this and adding or changing things around. Save files might not be compatible with previous versions of Gnamod and it is possible that in-between updates the world you are playing is no longer compatible with the current version.
Nothing in this version is final and if you find bugs please report them in the forum post. Current Version is 0.96b.

This is the old version (0.91) that will stay up here for a bit until I am all done with documentation (roughly until end of february). The saves from this version are not compatible with the new version. If you are planning on starting a new game, you should check out the 1.0 version instead.
