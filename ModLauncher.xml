  The same ServerGroup Name="" can be set in different files, and the Mod Launcher will group them under the same heading
  So we could do:   Regular.xml and Advanced.xml, and if they have the same ServerGroup Name, they'll be grouped together.

Welcome Survivors to Gnamod,
So what is Gnamod exactly? That is hard to explain in a short sentence, but I will give it a try: Gnamod is a collection of mods that aims to enhance the ' Vanilla' Experience of the 
base 7 Days to Die game. This means that the mod is purely XML based and tries to remain as close as possible to the survival gameplay that the game already offers./n
/n
Versions: 
Gnamod Base 16 - The Core Experience./n
Gnamod Beta - As it is being developed, may contain buggy or not working features./n
Gnamod Clientversion - This version can be used when connecting to any Gnamod server if you dont want to install the whole mod./n

Gnamod as it is being developed, this version is the current work and thus may contain unfinished stuff or things that are not working (yet). 
This version currently comes with a flat world for building and testing.
