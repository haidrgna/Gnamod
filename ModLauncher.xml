ServerGroup Name=""   
  - This controls the top level heading in the Mod Launcher for the mod. All the <Server> tags will be under it.
  
  The same ServerGroup Name="" can be set in different files, and the Mod Launcher will group them under the same heading
  So we could do:   Regular.xml and Advanced.xml, and if they have the same ServerGroup Name, they'll be grouped together.

Server Name=""
  - This sets the unique name of each mod.

Welcome Survivors to Gnamod,
So what is Gnamod exactly? That is hard to explain in a short sentence, but I will give it a try: Gnamod is a collection of mods that aims to enhance the ' Vanilla' Experience of the 
base 7 Days to Die game. This means that the mod is purely XML based and tries to remain as close as possible to the survival gameplay that the game already offers.
