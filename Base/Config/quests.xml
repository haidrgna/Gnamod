description="The first thing you need to do is gather the most basic materials from around you, materials that if you look carefully can be found almost everywhere: Wood, Plant Fibers, Stone and Feathers. Look for birdnests on the ground as they may contain feathers you need to fletch arrows from. The following instructions will teach you how to craft basic tools and weapons from these materials, tools you will need if you want to gather larger quantities of these materials."
